# tutorial-GitHub
## A fork from Programming Historian
- I tried to make the instructions more obvious when I used this in 5360 in September 2016.
- I will not use this again -- instead I'll fork it again, keeping the rationale but teaching students how to use Github.com without the Desktop
- Desktop is too cumbersome for someone who is only editing 2 or 3 documents.
